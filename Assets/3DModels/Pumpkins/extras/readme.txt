Pumpkins Pack v1.0
from Moondog Games

----------

Description:

8 pumpkins for fall and Halloween! High detail versions and mobile optimized versions included.
Perfect for spooky fantasy worlds or Halloween scenes.

This pack of pumpkins and jack-o-lanterns includes:
- 8 standard resolution meshes (500-1000 triangles) with unique 1024 by 1024 texture sets
- 8 low resolution meshes (150-200 triangles) which share a texture atlas
- Many prefab variations with lit and unlit versions of the jack-o-lanterns



Also included is an example scene with examples of optimized shaders applied, and notes detailing each set up.

----------

Inside the Pumpkins folder there are separate folders for the high resolution and low resolution sets. Each set has a folder of Prefabs ready to place in a scene.

For the low resolution Prefabs, there are several variations with optimized materials which use fewer textures. Users will notice an increase in the brightness of these optimized materials as they do not use the specular mask textures.

The specular masks in this pack are intended to give a subtle matte appearance to the materials. The materials which use the specular masks were not intended to be very shiny. If a shiny appearance is desired, the standard 'Bumped Specular' shader might be a better option for your scene.

An example scene is included in the 'extras' folder. This is not a game play example. This scene allows the user to view all of the prefabs under typical lighting conditions with the materials applied. There are also brief notes in the scene which describe each row of prefabs.

The high resolution set have Mesh Colliders which use the same high detail mesh as the Mesh Renderer. It is possible to reuse the low resolution meshes as the Mesh collider instead. Although the high resolution and low resolution meshes are closely aligned, there may be small differences in the shape. If 'pixel perfect' accuracy is desired, (as is sometimes necessary for collision detection, ray casts or decal application) then we recommend keeping the high resolution mesh as the Mesh Collider.

One final note: each of the high resolution prefabs use multiple unique 1024 by 1024 textures. This can use a lot of memory if all the prefab variations are used in your scene! If memory use is a concern, consider changing the Max Size setting for each texture.
